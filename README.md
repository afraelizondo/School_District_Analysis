# School District Analysis

## Overview

In this project, as a Data Analyst, I assisted Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district. She is in charge of the analysis of information from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. This role, she is tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.

These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. In this module, you'll be helping Maria analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance.
