# School District Analysis

## Overview

In this project, as a Data Analyst, I assisted Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district with the analysis of information from a variety of sources.  The purpose of it, is to prepare standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and the final output will be visualize the data to create a presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns in the schools of this district. 

Based on the student's math and reading scores, we aggregated the data and found trends in school performance.

These insights are gonna be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level.
