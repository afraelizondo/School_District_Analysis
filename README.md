# School District Analysis

## Overview

In this project, as a Data Analyst, I assisted Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district with the analysis of information from a variety of sources.  The purpose of it, is to prepare standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and the final output will be visualize the data to create a presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns in the schools of this district. 

Based on the student's math and reading scores, we aggregated the data and found trends in school performance.

These insights are gonna be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. 

## Results

1. In general, they got better scores in reading than in math, so this could lead to implement some other teaching techniques with this subject so they can improve it.

2. Also we can see there were students with perfect grade of 100 out of 100, keeping track of them would be great so they can give some advise to other students with lower grades.

3. Even the public schools had a greater average budget, they had lower test score results in comparation with the charter schools.


4. There is a huge difference between the highest and lowest number of students in the schools: Montgomery with 2038 students vs. Chang with 171 students, so this can be another element to take into account.

### Other kind of analysis that can be performed:

- Comparison between the asigned budget for each school and score results.

- Comparison between number of students in public vs. charter schools.

- Best students of each grade of the schools.
